## Purpose

This project was created from my passion for custom mechanical keyboards. I've always been fond of video games, especially on the PC platform. With PC gamers, their main weapon of choice are obviously mouse and keyboard. I used to use random keyboards until I bought myself my first mechanical keyboard off Amazon during freshman year of college. I ended up lending it to my brother as I got a free mechanical keyboard when I purchased a new rig a year after. I used it for some time until one day, something went wrong with the software update for the keyboard and it stopped functioning. This is what sparked my venture into the world of bespoke mechanical keyboards. I was amazed at all the endless possibilities you could make with mechanical keyboards, and I wanted one for myself. I spent hours on research learning about what there was to know about building your own custom mechanical keyboard. I ended up building a Tofu65 from KBDFans as my first custom keyboard. It was my daily driver until COVID-19 happened. This was the point where the sparks met the bomb, and I starting looking more and more into custom mechanical keyboards as I was stuck at home all day with nothing better to do. 

Up until now, I've built about 20 custom mechanical keyboards, and still have more on the way. As time went on, the keyboard world also grew exponentially larger due to the pandemic, as more and more people started working from home and have also seen the beauty of mechanical keyboards. I would often help beginners in Discord groups as well as my IRL friends who were interested in building their first mechanical keyboard. Many beginners will easily get stuck on the many aspects of building a custom mechanical keyboard, and may often come across issues on their journey to building their very own board. This website was born out of the idea of helping those beginners understand the backbone and in's-and-out's of the mechanical keyboard world. 

## Details

The technologies used to make this website are React v18.0, React-Router v6.3, and Tailwind CSS v3.0.24. The focus of this project was utilizing React-Router for the routing to different pages and Tailwind CSS for ease of styling. I started out using the create-react-app boilerplate, followed by adding react-router and then tailwindcss. I spent most of my time figuring out the styling for the pages and the overall layout, as well as making the website viewable on mobile devices. 

One hickup that I came across was figuring out how to have the website work on Github Pages. After some research I found out I would have to change my initial approach of using BrowserRouter to HashRouter. I had to tweak the code to implement the change, and also had an issue with my table of contents links. Ended up having to use a package called react-router-hash-link to allow scrolling to a specific part of the page when clicked.

## Project Status

This project is still in development. The overall layout and navigations are complete, and the first three chapters of the introduction course are written up. Currently working on writing up the rest of the chapters and touching up on the styling.
